Access Control
--------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:melvincarvalho`

Introduction
============

The Base Access Control Strategy is:

- GET: anyone can read
- PUT: only authenticated users can write

This can be extended in future to many different types of access control in line with [WebACL](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl)

Use Cases
=========

- Public Wikipedia ([suggested](https://primal.net/e/note1rvpw0sjfgqp7lszuaysz7lxm9gc53xy243vl25r8gz54pxdd2lusqgernq) by Jack)
- I wonder if it could be adapted to use web of trust so that only people in a certain list or people that you follow and follow you could log into a certain site ([suggested](https://primal.net/e/note1mz62wrkf8mmf6l78xel54gq45g0ke8u9g22m8ctfdns6k54jdu7s77khee) by Ocean)
