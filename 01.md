1. Introduction

In the nostr system, identity is represented by a globally unique public key. This public key can be encoded and transmitted using various formats, such as the npub system, nostr:pubkey:hex, or the DID URI. This specification will describe each encoding format and their recommended use cases.

2. Encoding Formats

2.1. Nostr Public Key

A nostr public key is the raw hex-encoded public key that serves as a globally unique identifier for an entity in the nostr system.

2.2. Npub System

The npub system is an alternative encoding format that represents a nostr public key. It provides a compact and efficient representation of the unique identifier.  Npub uses bech32 in the front end to encode a key.

2.3. DID URI

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) URI is another equivalent form that can be used to represent a nostr public key. It is a self-sovereign and decentralized identity solution that offers better interoperability with other identity systems.

3. Usage in Signed Events and Headers

The identity encoding formats can be utilized in various ways, such as in signed events or specific headers, to verify the identity of an entity.

3.1. Authentication Header

The raw hex-encoded public key is often sent within a signed event via the Authentication header. This enables the receiver to verify the identity of the sender.

3.2. Nostr Header

Identity information may also be sent using the nostr: header. This method provides an alternative way to transmit identity information, while maintaining flexibility in choosing the preferred encoding format.
