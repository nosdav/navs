## Introduction

NosDAV is a data space that benefits from adopting hyperlinks, enabling seamless connections between files, creation of lists, and providing data for apps.

The preferred data serializations are JSON and JSON in HTML, which allow for interactive applications over NosDAV.

Links in JSON loosely conform to the Linked Data and Linked Objects specifications, using the `@id` syntax to denote hyperlinks.

## Vocabularies

Vocabularies can provide self-documenting specifications that offer insights into JSON structures for developers and machine-readable hints for automated systems.

The first Nostr vocabulary is located at:

[https://w3id.org/nostr#Relay](https://w3id.org/nostr#Relay)

Additional vocabularies can be created following this pattern.

While vocabularies are not mandatory, they enhance the user experience. Developers can use plain JSON to get started, and adopt vocabularies to further improve their applications.
