## Introduction

NosDAV is a data space which benefits from the adtoption of hyperlinks.  In this way it is possible to link from one file to another, create lists, and provide data for apps.

The preferred serializations of data are JSON or JSON in HTML which allows for interactive applications, over NosDAV.

Links in JSON conform loosely to the Linked Data and Linked Objects specifications which denotes hyperlinks in JSON with the `@id` syntax.

## Vocabs

Vocabs can provide self documenting specifications which provide insights into the JSON for developers and machine readable hints for machines.

The first nostr vocab is located at:

https://w3id.org/nostr#Relay

Many more can be created in this way.

Vocabs are not mandatory, and it should be possible to use plain old JSON to get started.
