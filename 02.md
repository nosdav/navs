--------------------------------------

Introduction
============

The HTTP verbs PUT and GET are covered in the [NosDAV Core Spec](https://nosdav.com/spec/)

[WebDAV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918#section-9) itself specifies more verbs, many of which are not needed


2.1. Required Verbs

These verbs are essential for a functional NosDAV implementation:

    GET: Retrieves a resource.
    PUT: Updates or creates a new resource.

2.2. Recommended Verbs

These verbs are not required, but their implementation is strongly recommended for a robust and user-friendly NosDAV service:

    HEAD: Retrieves metadata of a resource. (Recommended if GET is implemented)
    OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for a resource. (Should be implemented, especially with CORS)
    POST: Creates a new resource or appends data to an existing resource. (May be implemented for append-only folders)
    DELETE: Removes a resource. (Optional)

2.2. Optional Verbs

These verbs are not mandatory but can enhance the functionality should you wish full WebDAV compliance:

    PROPFIND: Retrieves properties of a resource. (Not recommended)
    COPY: Duplicates a resource. (Not recommended)
    MOVE: Moves a resource to a new location. (Not recommended)
    LOCK: Applies a lock to a resource. (Not recommended)
    UNLOCK: Removes a lock from a resource. (Not recommended)
