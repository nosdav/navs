Introduction
============

Identity uses a globally unique nostr pubkey.  An alternative encoding for this is the npub system or nostr:pubkey:hex.  Similarly a DID URI is an equivalent form.  The raw hex pubkey is often sent in a signed event, via an Authentication header to verify the idenitty.  Identity MAY be sent in a nostr: header
