## List

- [Nostr Spec](https://nosdav.com/spec/)

## Criteria for acceptance of NAVs

1. They should be implemented in at least one server and one relay -- when applicable.
2. They should make sense.
3. They should be optional and backwards-compatible: care must be taken such that clients and servers that choose to not implement them do not stop working when interacting with the ones that choose to.
4. Other rules will be made up when necessary.
