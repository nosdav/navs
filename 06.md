Introduction
============

Content Types are covered in the core spec.  NosDAV provides a rich declarative data store including hyperlinks.  Included types are:

- html
- json
- txt

More is better.  JSON in html must also be supported, via structured data islands.  This paves the way for Nostr Linked Data.
